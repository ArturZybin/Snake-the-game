# Snake-the-game
Simple browser game created using only clean JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
Nearly all the elements are interactive, you can drag the snake cage and drop it to the field, take the candy gift and more.
Snake and field are also editable, you can set their parameters at the settings.
Enjoy the game =)

P.S. If you are learning JS now and want to understand how the game works, I advise you to check the commit history, it is detailed enough

P.P.S Sorry about text mistakes, I am not native
